 3. **Audio enhancement** -  Refers to the process of improving the quality, clarity, and intelligibility of audio signals. Denoising, a crucial aspect of audio processing, is essential for removing unwanted noise, distortions, or artifacts from audio recordings.

 4. **Some key terms in audio processing.** -
    
    **Amplitude** — Perceived as loudness
    
    **Frequency** — Perceived as pitch
    
    **Sample rate** — It is how many times the sample is taken of a sound file if it says sample rate as 22000 Hz it means 22000 samples are taken in each second.
    
    **Bit depth** — It represents the quality of sound recorded, It just likes pixels in an image. So 24 Bit sound is of better quality than 16 Bit.
